## Overview

This codebase trains a language model to extract a list of actionable points from a given email, using an original email dataset generated using data inversion. 
 are used with pretrained language models to generate the dataset.
The language model is then evaluated with our handwritten dataset.

## How to run

### 1. Setup

Install the project dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Data Generation
We generate the original email dataset by prompting another pretrained language model with self-crafted actionable and non-actionable points to write an email. The datapoints are then inverted to create an email-to-actionable points dataset. 

Data generation script handles all possible ways to generate data:

```
python data_generation/data_generator.py
```

Our datasets can be found in the `data` directory:

```
# data generated by InstructGPT3
gpt_generated_data.jsonl

# data generated by Bloom
bloom_generated_data.jsonl

# handwritten dataset for evaluation
handwritten_data.jsonl
```

### 3. Finetune bloom

Finetuning was done from a Jupyter notebook: 
```
finetuning/bloom_finetune.ipynb
```

### 4. Run evaluation script

Evaluation was done from a Jupyter notebook:
```
finetuning/bloom_loss.ipynb
```
